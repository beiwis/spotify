Certainly! There are several websites and tools that can help you identify the genre of a song. One such tool is [**Chosicâ€™s Music Genre Finder**](https://www.chosic.com/music-genre-finder/). It allows you to find the genre of any song or artist by entering the song title or artist name in the search box. 

The tool uses databases of Spotify and Wikipedia to match the song and display its genre, key, BPM, and popularity.
